# ðŸš€ Quick Railway Deployment Fix

## Problem Fixed:
The original deployment failed because Railway couldn't find a start command and the dependencies were too heavy.

## âœ… Solution Applied:

### 1. Created Simplified API (`main_api_simple.py`)
- Minimal dependencies
- No heavy ML libraries initially 
- Basic FastAPI server with health checks
- API endpoints for LLM provider list

### 2. Updated Configuration Files:
- `requirements.txt`: Ultra-minimal dependencies
- `railway.json`: Proper start command
- `Procfile`: Backup start command

### 3. Environment Variables Needed in Railway:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here (optional)
```

**Note:** Use your actual API keys from your local `.env` file when setting up Railway environment variables.

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps:

1. **Push these changes to GitHub**
2. **In Railway:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Add the environment variables above
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - The simplified API should now deploy successfully

3. **After successful deployment:**
   - Copy the Railway URL (e.g., `https://your-app.railway.app`)
   - Update Vercel's `VITE_API_BASE_URL` environment variable

## ðŸ§ª Testing:
- Health check: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- Settings API: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/settings`

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancement:
Once the basic deployment works, we can gradually add back the ML dependencies in future updates.
